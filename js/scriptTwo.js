// Math Operators
const value = 3 - 2
const valueTwo = 6 / 2
const valueThree = 10 * 2

// Get positive or negative number
const isPositive = 17 % 2

// Math Addition or String Concatenation
const res = '2' + 2
const resTwo = 2 + 2
const resThree = 'two' + ' ' + 'three'

// Whenever you pass one number and a string to addition operator,
// it will change the number type to string type and will do concatenation

// Whenever you pass one number and a string to any operator other than addition,
// it will change the string type to number type and will run the operator logic


const val = 2 ** 3

/* 
Comparison

- greater than (>)
- less than (<)
- equal (== and ===)
- not equal (!= and !==)

- (==) compares values only
- (===) compares both values and types

All of these comparisons will return boolean value (true or false)
